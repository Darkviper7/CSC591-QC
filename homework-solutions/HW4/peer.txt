Peer evaluations
----------------

Please indicate a score on a scale of 0..100% for the work performance
of your group peers. A score of 100% certifies that your peer
performed his/her part of the group work as assigned and nobody needed
to pick up unfinished work from this peer. A score of 50% indicates
that the peer only did half of what was required. The other half could
have been left unfinished or picked up by someone else. (If it was
picked up by someone else, the other peers may get extra credit at
the end of the class, see policies.) Feel free to add additional peer
entries if needed.
